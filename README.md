Objective:
 This project aims to analyze and visualize key metrics of customer bank loans to provide actionable insights for better loan management and risk assessment. By leveraging Tableau,
 I created a comprehensive dashboard that highlights important financial trends and patterns in loan data.

Description:
Using a detailed finance data sheet, I developed an interactive dashboard that showcases various aspects of customer loans. Key features of the dashboard include:
KPI Cards displaying Total Funded Loan Amount, Average Interest Rate, and Total Loans Issued
1. Year-wise Loan Amount Trends to observe loan volume growth.
2. Grade and Sub-grade Analysis for revolving balances
3. Verified vs. Non-Verified Payment Comparison to understand payment reliability
4. State-wise and Month-wise Loan Status Distribution for regional insights
5. Home Ownership vs. Last Payment Date Analysis to correlate ownership with payment behavior.

 This analysis provides an in-depth look at customer loan portfolios, assisting stakeholders in identifying areas of potential risk and growth. The project was instrumental in refining my skills in data transformation and visualization within the financial sector.
